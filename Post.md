### Business Understanding

#### Brief description

Let's imagine that you are a programmer and wondering how to increase you're salary. Project follows the CRISP-DM process

Based on data colected by Stackoverflow in 2017 Annual Developer Survey, I wil give you some hints, what might be beneficial for you or what makes no much a difference in terms of salary.
There are 64,000 reviews from 213 countries, survey aims to understand aspects of jobs related to software development and data analytics.

...

In below analysis, I will show following aspects related to salary size:

#### Question I: More programming languages you know - more you earn?

#### Question II: If you know Python, you earn more?

#### Question III: Location makes a difference?

...

### Data Understanding

#### Access and Explore

Data used comes from Stack Overflow. Licensing for the data and other information can be found at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). 

### Prepare Data

#### Wrangle and Clean

The goal of data wrangling is to assure quality and useful data. This follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.

### Question I: More programming languages you know - more you earn?

#### Analyse

Majority of asked people can program in 3 languages (more than 20%). When narrowing down data to programmers who can program in 6 or less, there is a hughe jump in avarage Salary from one known language or two (from 53,000 to 58,000) but then there is stable with an exception in knowledge of 3 programming languages (salary is low).

#### Explain the visualisation

If you know one programing lanugage, getting to know second programming language will increase you're salary. However, knowledge about third or more will not make much of a difference.

...

### Question II: If you know Python, you earn more?

#### Analyse

Let's compary programmers who knows Python versus those, who doesn't.

#### Visualise

#### Explain the visualisation

It turned out that YES!
If you know Python, you earn more.

...

### Question III: Location makes a difference?

#### Analyse

I've also checked if it is true that salary depends on programmer's location.

In the first chart it is shown that programmers loacted in North America earn much more than those located other parts of the world.

#### Visualise

I've narrowed this to Europe and added Excpected Salary.

#### Explain the visualisation

It looks like programmers in all location think that they will earn less that they actualy are earning.
It makes a huge diference if you are based in Switzerland than in Latvia or Poland.

...

### Evaluation

#### Findings

To sum up, if you would like to increase you're salary:
1) learn at least 2 programming languages
2) one of those should be Python
3) move to North America or Switzerland

What is the easiest of those for you to do? ;)
