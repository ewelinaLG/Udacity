### Introduction

Let's imagine that you are a programmer and wondering how to increase you're salary.

Based on data colected by Stackoverflow in 2017 Annual Developer Survey, I wil give you some hints, what might be beneficial for you or what makes no much a difference in terms of salary.
There are 64,000 reviews from 213 countries, survey aims to understand aspects of jobs related to software development and data analytics.

...

In below analysis, I will show following aspects related to salary size:

### I: More programming languages you know - more you earn?

### II: If you know Python, you earn more?

### III: Location makes a difference?

...

### I: More programming languages you know - more you earn?

Majority of asked people can program in 3 languages (more than 20%). When narrowing down data to programmers who can program in 6 or less, there is a hughe jump in avarage Salary from one known language or two (from 53,000 to 58,000) but then there is stable with an exception in knowledge of 3 programming languages (salary is low).
