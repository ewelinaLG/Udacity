## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. More programming languages you know - more you earn?
2. If you know Python, you earn more?
3. Location makes a difference?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
There are also couple .png files that were used in Post.md

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/ewelinaLG/Udacity/blob/main/Post.md).

Data used comes from Stack Overflow. Licensing for the data and other information can be found at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
